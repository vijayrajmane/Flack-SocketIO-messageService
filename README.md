In this project I have created an web app called Flack which is online message service.
SocketIO is used for real time chat. This is a one page application. Javascript is used to run server-side code.
In this app where user has to enter the name which is associated with message in chats and will be remembered even after closing the browser.
User has to create a channel as long as it doen't conflict name with other channel. After creating channel it is add to channel list.
On clicking on channel chat window for that channel is opened.
Mesaage send by user is associated with timestamp and name.
User can delete its own message by clicking delete button which is visible if you hover over the message.
